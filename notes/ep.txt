package.jso is configuration for projectnpm.
there are two type of depency-
        1- dev dependency-  require during development
        2 normal -  require in production npm install -D parcel 

package.json- ^, ~ keep nearby or lattest version
packagelock.json- it keeps the exact version of dependency whih is installed



npx - similar to npm(install a package) , executing a package


Parcel - 
        Dev build
        HMR - Hot Module Replacement
        File watching Algorithm (C++)
        doing caching
        iamge optimization
        Bundling
        compressing file(remove white space)
        Differential Bundling to app to support older browser
        Host in HTTPS
        Tree shaking algorithm(remove unused code)
        different build for production and devðŸš€  

parcel assign Babel to transpiles the jsx to javascript.



React Fiber (Reconcilation Algo)- it find diff between the actual and virtual DOM, them change the actual DOM


useEffect(callbackfunction, dependency array)
 there are 3 cases 
        1 - if there no dependencyarray then callback is called every  time, component is rendered
        2- if there empty depency array then ,called back is called only initial render(1)

        useSate -
        useEffect-
        useParam- (react Router Dom) for extracting path variable


chunking,
dynamic bundelling
code splitting
 lazy loading 


 State Uplifting
 Control and Uncontrol Compomnent - (control by parent - controlled componen), has use State,control by itself call uncontrolled component
